Now You Code 3: Final Grade in IST256

Our Course Syllabus has a grading scale here:

http://ist256.syr.edu/syllabus/#grading-scale

Write a Python program to input a number of points earned out of 600 and then
outpus the registrar grade. After you get it working initially, re-write it
to handle bad input. 

For example:

    IST256 Grade Calculator
    Enter total points out of 600:  550
    Grade: A- 

Start out your program by writing your TODO list of steps
you'll need to solve the problem!

# TODO: List 

#1. input grade out of 600 points
#2. lookup letter grade (use an if else ladder for lower bound of each grade)
#3. print letter grade.

# TODO Write code here
