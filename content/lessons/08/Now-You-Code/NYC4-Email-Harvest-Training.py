Now You Code 4: Email Harvesting Training

Description

Write a program to extract the email addresses from the mailbox
file "NYC4-mbox-short.txt" and save them into another file
"NYC4-emails.txt" with one extracted email address per line.

The best way to find the emails in the mailbox file is to search
for lines in the file that begin with "From:". When you find an email
write just the address (not "From:" and the address) to
"NYC4-emails.txt", and don't worry about duplicates.

The program should print the number of emails it wrote to the file.

Example Run:

Wrote 27 emails to NYC4-emails.txt


Start out your program by writing your TODO list of steps
you'll need to solve the problem!
